    "text": "Originally published in UCSF Synapse.Honorable Mention in the Nonfiction category of the 2023 UCSF Synapse Storytelling Contest.\n“Don’t walk on the grass. Only Fellows can walk on the grass,” Asif warns us, unserious. I puncture the steadfast walls of immaculate stone, climbing through a tiny doorway punched out of the massive wooden gates a foot off the ground. The air is thick with the mist that bathed our walk from the Mathematics Institute.\nI see Eleni walk up to the perfectly manicured lawn and defiantly plant her foot down. Nothing happens.\nMagdlen College sprawls past the river bordering central Oxford. We walk over a small wooden bridge to a gravel trail encircling one of the College’s two deer parks. The walk is lined with bright yellow flowers, eerie spots of color. Eleni is surprised they are so well-preserved: at Cambridge, the undergraduates usually leave none standing.\nAs the blooms sway in the wind and the water meanders past, I lose myself in gentleness. My body dissolves. Arms, legs, eyes and skin are not my own, and my consciousness — pure heat and electricity — spans across moments, heavy with history and place. I see Oscar Wilde walk down the steps from his accommodation and stroll through the deer park on an April afternoon like this one, awash in quiet melancholy, the vastness of gray sky and green lawn. The green is strange for this Californian, acclimated to the yellows and browns of drought. I see all around me the billowing robes of 15th century Bible scholars — the College is new, and so many pages are yet-unwritten.\nMy scattered shards of self shear and shatter in time’s turbulence. I wonder where I am. I turn my head: the group is on to the next attraction, back toward the courtyard, the central artery between the dining hall, the common rooms, and the like.\n“I feel like we have to make a bet here, now; what should it be?” Nader echoes from beyond the entryway, unanswered. We pass through the College’s ancient walkways — past rows of intricate arches, cramped doorways, shadowy corridors leading up toward faculty offices and classrooms for tutorials. At the front, Asif turns a corner and heads up a couple flights of narrow stairs, past a sign reading “Senior Common Room”. He swipes his badge at the door, which clicks open after a foreboding delay. The five of us enter, passing rows of long black robes and brightly colored hoods.\nWe gather beside a low, backless chair, awkwardly stationed beside the nearest window looking out onto the courtyard. The chair is unadorned except for a small sliding weight on the left arm — a balance. On the windowsill is a leather-bound ledger filled with dozens of dates, names, and weights in stones and pounds. Asif, our impromptu historian, points to an entry: “Edwin Schrödinger,” it reads.\n“This was his first High Table dinner here, his induction as a Fellow,” we are told. “Right before, from that phone” — he points to a 1930s telephone hanging on the wall — “they got the call that he had won the Nobel Prize.” I walk to a plexiglass case across the room, below a tapestry older than the Constitution. On the bottom shelf is a tasteful arrangement of four 18th-century flintlock pistols; above them sits a small jewelry case holding a beautifully polished Nobel. (“Not Schrödinger’s,” I’m told.)\nOne by one, the others sit in the chair, reading off their weights in those awkward British units. On my turn, I stare into the brown leather upholstery, and feel nothing but tension. I decline; it is an honor I haven’t earned.\nNader has settled on a bet now. “How about: In five years, ‘many-worlds’ will be the dominant quantum interpretation.”\n“I’d take that bet,” Asif responds, smiling wryly, perusing an ancient dissertation pulled from a bookshelf.\n“Oh yeah? How will you measure that?” Gabriel is characteristically blunt, through his thick Portuguese accent.\n“I guess when Jim says it’s true.” Nader chuckles; then, the four physics grad students all start laughing. Jim will never say it’s true.\nI met Jim the day before in a spotless seminar room in the Wiles building, conspicuously beautiful for a math department. He was confident — perhaps overly so, perhaps not — that “language does not live on a line”. Meaning — a yarn ball of strings and boxes, concepts and relationships — seems vastly bigger than the jumble of symbols we throw around at each other. I wonder now if mind does not live on a line, either. Perhaps the focus of this conference — the mathematics of consciousness — is missing the point too, settling for the shiny veneer to avoid the boundless ocean beneath. But then I remember my own sloppy anarchism, my fear of groups of more than four people. I wonder where my distaste for this enterprise really comes from.\nWe never settle on terms for the bet. Instead, we walk outside toward the outskirts of town in search of some decent — non-British — food. Eleni is 21 and doing her second master’s; she tells me that the most pressing concern for humanity is to end death. She strategizes about transitioning from quantum theory to neuroscience, about unlocking the secrets of immortality. I recall my own stint with transhumanism — a dinner at a kitschy diner in Baltimore with Aubrey de Grey and a few giddy philosophy majors, a plastic baby staring down at us from the technicolor ceiling.\nWhat happened to that passion? I think. End death — that’s a real goal.\nI am in that cold Maryland December twelve years ago — a late night in the library, huffing espresso fumes to force myself awake, flailing feverishly to get a brain decoder working to impress the grad student supervising me. The blue fluorescents and vomit-colored carpet in the windowless basement stacks tinge pixelated traces of a patient’s hand position, squiggling back and forth in a Matlab figure window. I feel like solving this will solve everything.\nThe sun has set on the narrow, wet Oxford street. In twelve years, my ambition has sunk to mocking Dan Huberman’s three-hour pitch for testosterone-enhancing Yerba maté, self-righteously sipping tequila-sodas at my neighborhood haunt. But then again, I remind myself, I quite like that ritual.\nWe settle on a Persian place. They close in 15 minutes, but the staff are too polite not to seat us. As the drinks and appetizers come out, Gabriel looks over to me and asks, “So, how about you. What’s your metaphysics?”\n“I’m an idealist,” I tell him, taking a sip of tea. The four look at each other.\n“Really?” Asif asks, incredulous, his teeth showing through a broad smile.\n“Alright. Sell it to me, then.” Gabriel is deadpan, gesturing to me with both arms.\n“Well, I don’t know if it’s right. But it’s nice to think about.”\nGabriel looks off to the side and upward toward the ceiling moldings. He scratches his chin, then looks straight into me. “So what then, material reality is … correlations in experience structure, or something?” I enjoy the way he says “correlations”, wiggling his fingers together to illustrate.\n“More or less, yeah.” The waitstaff start stacking chairs on the other tables.\nGabriel purses his lips and nods a little. “Interesting …” he trails off. Our lamb platters arrive, barely squeezing onto the thin table. Then the group asks me what’s up with Americans and guns.\n\n \n“Looks good; Dr. A will be in to see you in a minute,” the technician says, pulling the blood pressure cuff off my arm.\n“Great.” I double-check that I have everything. My turquoise journal is open next to me, “Session 26” scrawled at the top of the page. I unlock my phone; up pops the article I was reading on the Muni over:\n\nUnder basal conditions, activation of cortical extra-synaptic GluN2B-selective NMDARs acts through the mTOR signaling pathway to suppress protein synthesis, which maintains synaptic homeostasis …\n\nI dismiss the word salad and open Spotify instead. Muscle memory takes over: gear, playback, 12 second cross-fade. Library, “KAP IM Session 3” — downloaded. Play, pause. Shuffle on, off, on, off.\nThe doctor comes in, and after a brief chat about my travels, he hands me the first spray. I blow my nose, lean back, and snort the meds — right nostril first, then left. I recognize the subtle metallic taste of the ketamine in the back of my throat; these days, it’s more of a comfort than a nuisance.\nI think back to the intention I had written in my journal. The trip had been hard — God, that first night in London.\nI am back, alone, lying in my tiny Airbnb, walls spray-painted with gold Rustoleum. In memory, I am half-dreaming, looking up from the twin bed filling the room at the shadow of a seven-year-old child, a haze in scattered light from a clip-on LED desk lamp. I can feel his foot pressing my face into the dirt at the edge of the schoolyard. I know he knows no one can see. I see myself from outside, alone in the shimmering darkness, wandering through my pocket universe.\nI watch myself get up and walk down the quiet Islignton backstreet to the nearest bodega, lodged in the negative space between a café and an auto repair shop. I ask the clerk for a vape pen; he points wordlessly to the dizzying rainbow of flavors behind him, distracted by something happening on a head-sized CRT television crammed into a haphazard shelf.\n“I have no idea, man; whatever people seem to like,” I tell him. He smiles, pulls one down, and hands it to me.\nWatermelon.\nI roll my eyes toward the cool fluorescents and fork over the foreign plastic money. I walk down to the canal by myself, leaving behind only a cloud of horrific flavor floating past the houseboats, backlit by yellow sodium streetlamps.\nMy mind is brought back to the office as the doctor hands me the second spray. On the far wall I notice the familiar, comically small print of a snow-capped mountain, lit in pink-purple alpenglow.\nBut I didn’t fall apart. I plug my left nostril. I loved that trip.\nIt had felt to me like being in those first uneasy talks about Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics a hundred years ago. I sniff in. It is so early now — before history has broken the symmetry, setting us down one path, free but predetermined. I sniff in the other nostril. I recall that the last year of treatment has been during my Saturn return. Saturn, the Old One, melancholy from the weight and the guilt of history. Saturn — wise in suffering, gold transmuted from lead. Saturn does not seek to end death; Saturn sees death for what it is.\nThe doctor leaves. I turn off the light, put my headphones on, and lay down in the massive chair. I close my eyes. This time, I see only swirling silhouettes; I wonder if perhaps I’m finally developing a tolerance. The come-on is gradual. But then it is sudden, and all at once, I’m undeniably in it.\nI see a shard of light, which I think must be a living cell, dividing in two. As the sister shards squirm and separate, they remain connected; I see their trajectories in spacetime, rotated and sliced through a different axis. I watch the eons of evolution unfold in form, connected and whole. Immobilized by ketamine, I relinquish a thin smile at the geometry of Darwin.\nLying there in the clinic, I walk into a clearing surrounded by wide trees. It is deep night, so dark that I can see every star in the Milky Way — the traces left over from that Tree of Life, enshrouded in clouds of purple. As I kneel in the tall grass, a ray of light passes through my pineal gland.\nNot cells. Ideas.\nThere! — in Orion’s belt, I see the birth of Beethoven’s 5th, a supernova condensing into a star-lineage that extends far beyond the angular resolution of the Sight behind my eyelids. I look around me, out into that awesome web of crystalline light piercing the infinite black. I am awash in fire.\n“God,” I say to myself, and reach for the gold Möbius strip hanging from my neck. “My God.” \\(\\,\\blacksquare\\)",

    "text": "Originally published in UCSF Synapse.First Place in the Fiction category of the 2024 UCSF Synapse Storytelling Contest.\nIt’s Christmastime, and over the hills, in the faraway furrows of one of those endless tracts of half-submerged land, a main battle tank sits in a ditch, decomposing, festering. My tank.\nBut the neighborhood seems to have forgotten, here in the shadow of the old Hospital, that shining ziggurat high above. An aspiration, once — and an obligation. Now it is only a reminder. A reminder of its offices emptied during the Reunification. Of the price of dissent. Of the swaying bodies of the Institute faculty on so many videos. I remember early in the War — remember the bitter, horrifying thrill of turning on my American friends’ VPN to see those videos, unsure if they were real, not caring if they were real.\nThese days, it seems difficult not to see them. We are meant to see them now.\nThe sun peeks out over the top of one of the short, older buildings along Irving. After the ’49 Revolution, most of the Avenues got Reclaimed — just row after row of concrete and glass, that iconic style of the Communist residential blocks. But this part of town was always nice; it got some cultural protection during the Old Regime, and never got built up like the rest of the Sunset.\nOur old money is worthless now. That’s fine enough for me; my work was always online and international anyhow. But a lot of my friends working for the big State enterprises — Apple, Tesla, Amazon, Uber — they really took a hit when the currency collapsed. I pull out my wallet and look for some cash to pay for my morning coffee.\nFive dollars, I think. Right — that’s about what coffee costs.\nEven six years out, I’m not quite used to the mental gymnastics of how much an American dollar is. I hand over the bill; it feels in my hand like worn cloth, a shred of someone’s shirt put through the wash too many times. We used to pay with our phones. We had for years.\nAll at once, I’m taken with a thought:\nI can’t believe we lost to these people.\nI give the bill over to Ezra, who’s been running this spot since I moved to the neighborhood. He isn’t political. His business involves putting things in hot water, and putting hot water through things.\n“You want that for here or to take it?” he asks, kind, genuine. He has a thick mustache and subtle stubble everywhere else. It’s a look that’s in right now. I hate it, but I’m the odd one out.\n“No, I’ll take it. That’s fine.”\nEzra hands me back a small paper cup, two bills, and some coins. There’s a little glass jar on the counter next to a case with some croissants and an oatcake. I made a mistake getting the oatcake a couple years ago. I drop the coins into the jar; it’s an odd ritual, but one I’m getting more used to.\nI walk down the block toward the metro stop.\nIt’s Saturday, I think. Why am I going in on a Saturday?\nBut here I am — not so much consciously, more of an automatism. It’s nice to be moving, more than anything. To have a place and time to go to that isn’t here and now. I walk down the steps, over their clicky metal tops. The walls are covered in ceramic hexagons, shaped to create this beautiful illusion where you can’t tell if they’re curved inward or outward. I remember appreciating that detail when I first moved here. But now I see a couple of them are cracked, and it gives the whole thing away: they’re definitely bubbled out.\nThe platform really used to be something, I imagine, back in the ’60s when the Old Regime built all the metro infrastructure. That iconic State architecture, clean and grand: the enormous concrete tube, lit edge-on in eerie, dim reds accentuating shadows cast by perfect imperfections in the intentionally unfinished wall. The long benches, austere rectangles of oak. The warm glow from enormous domes hanging overhead, matte black eggs with cream interiors. Even now, it looks like the future.\nExcept that now, there are homeless. A black man in a soiled red puffy jacket and a grey beanie is curled up on one of the long benches next to me as I wait. His mattress is a cardboard box, haphazardly split open to be somewhere close to the right dimensions for sleeping. Next to him is a black trash bag, full to bursting, contents unknown. I am uncomfortable.\nThen a distorted bell; a woman’s voice:\n“Now approaching: eastbound C to Fisherman’s Wharf.”\nThat was one of the first things they Made Great, the Muni voice. They used to have Spanish, Cantonese, Tagalog. I guess that one wasn’t so hard: all the announcements are software-generated. But when you ride twice or four times a day and hear those same voices, you get used to them. They’re odd friends. I used to work at a company in Hong Kong, and I was pretty shit at the language, but it always made me smile that I was good enough to get the transit announcements here at home. It reminded me we were part of a world.\nNow, even the English voice is a little different. Professional, sure. But also uncanny. Grotesque. Sexual — bizarrely sexual. And White. Very, very White.\nThe train rolls in, and the glass dividers open, beckoning to me and the one other person floating through on a Saturday morning, sipping their own coffee four cars over. I sit myself down on a long bench, solitary, and look up at the display. There are three trains bunched up ahead of this one, and an ad for Denny’s. Someone has keyed something into the polished steel frame, but the para-language hieroglyphs don’t mean anything to me. MTA used to be pretty good about polishing those things out, but whoever they got sold off to during Privatization realized they don’t have to care anymore.\nThe eight cars of the train are all connected by accordion umbilicals, and I look to the right, through their rugae, down the length of the train. The endless tube spasms and sways. A few meters from me, in a jumpseat next to the nearest umbilical, a skinny man is nearly a corpse, legs splayed out in front, head drooped to the side. I crane my neck to take a closer look at him: the crusty black hair, the lesions around his fingernails, the urine stains running down his grey bathrobe. But most telling are his eyes. Those wide, empty eyes. The eyes of a draugr — pupils constricted to a pinprick.\nI look down at the floor in front of me and sigh. A rogue Diet Coke bottle darts out from underneath my bench as we take a turn.\nWe must be crossing the Park, I think. Less than a minute to Geary.\nI look back at the man, and the details flood in. His skeleton. His still diaphragm. The small black dot tattooed below his right ear: his Neuralink conduit. I wonder if he was on the Front. I wonder who he was — before. When we were Comrades.\nI look down at my watch. It’s a little past 8:30.\n“Shit,” I whisper. I know the Geary stop’s probably empty.\nI drop the shoulder strap of my backpack, and zip open a compartment on the side where I keep my stims. I pull out the two polished silver discs, and keep them tight within my fists.\nWhat’s happening to this city? I think, already parallelized; most of my brain is planning.\nI get up and walk over to the man. I kneel and put my palms on either side of his head, stims behind the ears. I close my eyes. The discs ping him with a flurry of imperceptible pulses, and in my Sight, the circuit map starts to fill in — the fuzzy clouds of his axonal tracts, the superhighways within his skull. I hate that I’ve gotten so good at reading these tensor fields; I only learned to be a good Samaritan. But even with the best renderer, the seven-dimensional percept still feels like a Psilorex trip. I wade into him, feeling around for his retrosplenial cortex. A good segmentation takes five or six minutes, but Inside, the dilation is about eight-fold. And it’s worth it to be careful.\nThere.\nI have it, that little bundle deep in the back of this poor guy’s noggin. It feels almost like reaching into a vat of soft tofu and pulling out a nugget of firm. I stretch through the data-soup with my third arm — the stims’ electromagnetic field steering — and give the chunk of brain a tap.\nI open my eyes, forty seconds later. The train pulling in. The empty platform through the windows. The sound of the empty Diet Coke bottle, rattling.\nI pull the man’s arm over my shoulder and look back at his face. His eyes are blinking — that’s a good sign. But he’s not going to be happy in a minute. The doors to the metro car open; I hobble with him out onto the platform. I lay him down quick, and dash over to the thin column in the center of the cavernous station. I press the blue nub with my index finger, and the emergency speaker starts sputtering to life.\nThe new Oligarchs probably don’t bother to repair these either, I think. Why would they — can’t imagine anybody has pressed this since before the War.\nHalf a minute passes, dilated now by adrenaline.\n“Yes?” The operator’s voice finally comes over the intercom, almost unintelligible in the ocean of static.\n“Stop! Don’t shoot!”\nI look down at the man. He is still sitting on the yellow bumpy line where I dropped him, but now upright — hands straight to the sky, arms about to be liberated from their sockets. His terrified grey eyes are off in outer space, down toward the end of the platform, imploring no one.\n“Hey, you’ve gotta send some EMTs down here,” I tell the grating next to the blue light. “This guy was Dreaming on the eastbound C train. I think he’s getting shot by the cops or something.”\n“Ok, we’ll send someone to investigate——”\n“Please, I’m unarmed!” the man yells. I start to sweat.\nThis isn’t a good look. My eyes turn back to the open metro car doors, inviting.\n“Just stay where you are, and we’ll have someone there soon,” the intercom resumes. “Can you give me your name?”\nThe door alarm starts squawking; that one they haven’t changed since the ’60s. I hop back toward the train, over the man’s legs.\n“Sorry — I didn’t catch that!” I yell back behind me. The doors start closing, but I shove my arm in the gap.\n“Please stand clear of the doors,” the sexy woman’s voice returns, this time from the train intercom. The panels slide back, freeing me. I rush forward into the train.\nAnd then the man on the floor behind me screams.\nI close my eyes. I feel myself as I leave my body. It is a scream I know. An endless scream outside of time. A scream that pierces, that fractures, that liquefies and evaporates. The scream of men in combat. My men. Grey eyes. A shoulder patch — the star, the grizzly bear. The smell of burning meat. My tank. The black smoke shrouding the mountains above. The black reflection in the vast wet grid of the valley below.\nI look out from our position. In my Optics, I see the wall of American armor cutting through the infinite expanse of blossoming almond trees, a tornado of white petals and fire. An enemy F-35 buzzes us, and we feel it in the ground as much as the sky. There is nowhere to hide, nowhere to run to. I reach down and feel the cold steel.\nMy home. My fortress. \\(\\,\\triangleright\\)",

    "text": "I’m albino. My eyes are … different.  Originally published in UCSF Synapse.See the follow-up article from The Intelligencer.\nIn many ways, the world is not built for me. Every time I open Outlook on my iPhone and FaceID pops up, I have to pull the phone far away from its usual position — an inch and a half from my face — because the LIDAR sensors on the front that identify me were not designed to work at a distance that makes sense for my eyes.\nMy Photos app is mostly filled with pictures I’ve taken of menus at fast-food restaurants, or the occasional row of beer taps at a bar — I have no chance at knowing what’s there unless I can zoom in.\nI can’t legally drive without crazy-expensive bioptic telescopes that take months of training. I stopped biking to work after realizing that the spatial awareness needed to not get mowed down by lawless SF drivers was not something my depth-perception-less eyes could pull off.\nFor the most part, this didn’t cause too much of an issue for me in med school. As it turns out, most of the tasks that you need eyes for are amenable to assistive devices — for example, an iPhone-connected digital otoscope — that I could take along with me when I needed them. I could always do what I had to do.\nBut now I’m in grad school, working on a data science–heavy PhD, and I’m face-to-face with a nemesis that only lightly taunted me before: my computer.\nOh! — the fits of jealousy I have let out, watching people casually use their laptops at a reasonable, comfortable reading distance. If ever I am away from a 24-inch-plus monitor, my only hopes for being able to see my screen are to (A) contort myself so my face embedded in the display, (B) deal with the puny field of view of loupes, or (C) crank up the full-screen zoom feature built into macOS — a godsend, yes, but also a bit awkward when I have to blow up my Slack messages to 80 point font in the office to read them.\nYikes. Been burned by that one.\nAnd so, I pre-ordered Apple Vision Pro, even on my meager grad student stipend.\nNow, I’m not a newbie to working in a VR workstation; I spent my tech years doing computational work inside an Oculus Rift, despite the screen-door effect and the stream of ginger chews for the nausea. But Ooh! — the power of being surrounded on all sides by Jupyter notebooks!\nThe Vision Pro, though, is something to behold. If you want to know how good it is, just watch Apple’s ads. Or Minority Report. It really does just work as advertised. The inside-out tracking is so good that I can open a web browser in my office on the 6th floor of the Weill building, walk down the stairs to the kitchen on the 5th floor and check my email, and then walk back up the stairs to the 6th floor to find the browser exactly where I left it. It’s bananas.\nBut for me, the most amazing part is the attention to detail Apple has given to differences in vision.\nWear prescription glasses? Click in a pair of magnetic lens inserts from Zeiss — the headset registers your prescription when they’re attached and uses it to correct screen rendering and eye tracking artifacts.\nHave strabismus? No problem: the Accessibility menu lets you turn off foveated rendering (tough to do right for eyes that don’t come together) and switch the eye-tracked navigation to your dominant eye (or even to hand gestures only).\nEven my nystagmus and my lack of retinal melanin to absorb IR backscattering — both of which have befuddled research-grade eye tracking systems in the past — pose no issues for the Vision Pro, as long as I blow up the user interface a little bigger to account for the eye wiggles.\nWhich — I mean, why not? When your monitor is space, it’s not like you’re going to run out of room.\nYou may yuk it up as you’re taking candids of me out working on the quad. (Yes, I can see you.) But as a disabled person, the ability to finally sit back with my feet up on a bench out in the sun while working on my laptop — or more accurately, while working on a 30-foot-wide 4K screen floating in exactly the perfect ergonomic position, one that I can reposition anywhere I want it to be in any moment — is the answer to decades of prayers to the accessibility gods.\nCan’t read my text messages? Why don’t I just pull them right next to my face?\nNot enough room on my 13-inch laptop screen for the four code windows I’m looking at to be visible at the 20 point font I need to read? What if I just made the screen 15 feet tall?\nFor me, the extra bit of weight from strapping an iPad to my face is worth it. Because now I get to feel, for the first time, like I can use a computer the way I want to — and not the way I have to, because it’s designed for other people’s eyes.\nSo, if you see me with my Vision Pro on, don’t mind me — I’m just over here living in the 24th century like Geordi La Forge. \\(\\,\\blacksquare\\)",

    "text": "Every day presents us with its own lived character; yet, there are some things that keep us grounded—touchstones, totems that we know the feel of intimately, that allow us to hold on to the continuity of life despite its constant flux.\n\n\n\n“Steaming coffee cup sitting on a bistro table …” Drawn by Midjourney.\n\n\nFor me, that is coffee. From time to time, I visit a spot I’ve never been to so I can taste something exciting and new. But every day, once or twice a day, I stop in at my old stand-bys, the places whose coffee I know with the familiar precision of a mass spectrometer—every note, every contour of the activation of taste receptors from my mouth down throughout my GI tract. I know exactly the buzz I will get; I know exactly the feeling of full-body “Yes” that will take hold when I shove my nose into the top of the cup and take a big sniff of that intoxicating aroma. Coffee is the foundation—it is the ruler against which I measure the hours and days, the months and years.\nToday, however, my coffee tastes different. The wonderful nutty notes, that faint hint of celery—the perfect mélange of aromatics in the double-shot of espresso holding up my cappuccino like Atlas—all of it is muted. That joy and wonderment that fills me every time I experience the luxurious mouthfeel of perfectly steamed milk is gone, replaced by something boring, mundane, mechanical—sad.\nI know that the coffee isn’t different, because some part of me is still aware that the substance entering my mouth is fundamentally the same. I have lived inside of this mind long enough to know not to trust my perception to be a reflection of the real world around me. What has changed is entirely within myself: the model of the world that lays inside my mind, the blueprint used to “fill in” the details of my perception from the tenuous sensory connection that serves as my brain’s pathetic link with the external world.\n\n\n\n“Oldsmobile stationwagen parked on the street in Torrence, CA.” Drawn by Midjourney.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, I learned that my uncle died. He was 69—too young—and had spent the past decade living out of his car in Hawthorne, California. He wasn’t unhappy; he was quite okay to live this life outside of the system, outside of the merciless confines of a game that he saw had sown so much injustice. My uncle was very bright: he knew the ins and outs of my grandfather’s engineering work on the system that would become GPS with Magnavox in the 1960s. He had a deep knowledge of electronics and of politics. As his obituary put it, “He was an intelligent man with a mind of his own. … [H]e gave from the little he had to others he felt he could help, grieving when the help was too late or insufficient.”\nI didn’t know my uncle well. But when I learned of his death, I could watch as the world around me changed. Colors became muted. Music—a modality which normally triggers the most incredible synesthetic somatic sensations—felt flat and numb. Over the course of just a few minutes after reading that text from my mom, I could watch my perceptual world fall into darkness.\n\n \nBipolar disorder is often described medically in terms of its diagnostic criteria in the DSM 5, which center around mood episodes—ostensibly, the symptomatic manifestations of this brain difference. While the symptoms of mood episodes like depression or hypomania are certainly present for many (myself included), the diagnosis itself doesn’t explain why someone with bipolar disorder might be experiencing these states.\n\n\n\n“Human brain connections, 80s laser lights aesthetic.” Drawn by Midjourney.\n\n\nTo the neuroscientist—and to many a biologically-minded psychiatrist—the answer must lie somewhere in the biology of the nerve cells in the brain. Somewhere in that mass of electrical activity, or the wiring diagram of collections of neurons, or the biochemistry of cells’ messages to one another, there must be a finding that correlates with these mood changes; and one of those correlates, it follows, must be the lever that controls how we feel.\nBut perhaps that’s not the right approach. Maybe there is something that we can learn by interrogating the lived experience of people, without resorting to electrodes or microscopes.\nWhile ordinary waking consciousness gives us the lived character of witnessing the world as it actually is, the truth is that our perceptions are largely based on an internal model—a map inside each of our minds that captures our understanding of the interrelationships between concepts, things, and percepts in our own personal universe. Subjective experience certainly incorporates sensory data from the external world; however, that data is always interpreted in the context of the underlying internal model of the individual, such that one’s lived experience is as much a manifestation of oneself as it is a reflection of what lies beyond.\n\n\n\n“A model of the world in the palm of your hand.” Drawn by Midjourney.\n\n\nPart of the magic of possessing human experience lies in the fact that the internal model is so fabulously nonlocal: the exact way that light passes through the trees on a cool December morning evokes the feeling-tones of a long-lost memory—the apprehension of leaving my friends on the last day before winter break in elementary school. Our ability to arrange together these disparate pieces from across a lifespan underlies the immaculate beauty of our art—and the tremendous depth of our mental suffering.\nDepressed mood, then, is not just a statement about one’s instantaneous feelings or behavior. It is a statement of the entire universe in which one lives in a given moment. The crux of a depressive episode is not in its expression through syndromic criteria—the SIG E CAPS and DIG FAST familiar to every medical student. No: when one is depressed, one lives in a depressed world. In this state, the architecture of one’s internal model has been molded by the influence of a new set of axioms.\nThose axioms infect every concept and percept in our lexicon—every facet of our subjective being—through the associational laws that govern our internal model. Through that same mechanism that gives you that indescribable skin-crawling feeling when you listen to the score to Inception, because of the internalized understanding of brass harmony you have acquired via cultural reproduction and the psychophysics of audition. Through the same mechanism that, perhaps only a little bit, recalls the memory of my first awkward date in college, floating unseen in the background of my mind: accidentally ordering a $7 single-origin Ethiopian coffee in some hip spot in Baltimore; the winter sun; a near-forgotten conversation; the distinctive cherry overtones in that first sip. Every day when I order my second cappuccino, that engram awakens from the deep recesses of my unconscious, making my experience of coffee unmistakably my own.\n\n\n\n“Hop coffee shop in Baltimore with two large steaming …” Drawn by Midjourney.\n\n\nMy “pathology” doesn’t lie in the fraction of life I spend in mood episodes. It lies in the fact that my internal model is so easily shaped by the things that happen around me. When new data comes in, the axioms of my universe are rewritten in an instant. “I am a terrible person” is placed alongside the existence of gravity in my model of the universe. And, through the mind’s incredible ability to infer, these new axioms propagate to every corner of my conceptual map of reality—and then, to every facet of my lived experience.\nThe reality I walk through is as malleable as Play Doh—so malleable that it can be hard to trust that what my mind shows me is real. Perhaps that is pathology. But then again, there is something so familiar and universal about this process; I am not unique in that my internal model is shaped by the events of my life. Disappointments darken the world, and pleasant surprises giving us a lift; these are universal parts of the human experience. The aspect that is foreign is not the phenomenon itself, but only the degree. Perhaps the true pathology is that so many feel their reality is so real.\n\n \nMovement IV of Mahler 5—the Adagietto—comes up on my phone’s Spotify shuffle. This recording is of the Berliner Philharmoniker with Claudio Abbado conducting. Coming in at 9 minutes, the piece sounds to me as if I am hearing it for the first time. When it’s taken any slower, it is an overwhelmingly sad piece—an elegy, fit for mourning. But at this tempo, I feel the vibrancy of life and love. At 2:45, when the strings come in full force, my whole body is overcome with the warmth and vitality of the rejuvenating fire, starting at my ankles and shooting licks of flame up through my torso, my arms, past my cheeks and out my fingertips.\n\n\n\n“Dynamic photograph of Claudio Abbado passionately conducting.” Drawn by Midjourney.\n\n\nAs I take a sip from my coffee, I am met with the subtlety of cashew—an earthy palette of flavor that only an hour before had seemed masked, as though tasted with a clogged nose. As the final chord fades into the noise-canceled ether of my headphones, the blue of sky and the green of trees strike me with their rare brilliance. \\(\\,\\blacksquare\\)",

    "text": "Caution\n\n\n\nSpoilers.\n\n\n \nMuch can be said — has been said — about Oppenheimer.\nOf course, there are the tired, moralizing critiques that have become the impression-snagging, dopamine-bursting staples of our social-media-fuelled outrage machine. Yes, it is true: even in 2023, Christopher Nolan would certainly be shocked to learn that women are independent agents with their own thoughts and motivations. Similarly, there are those who variously lambast the film’s perceived glorification or vilification of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy). (Though, make no mistake: to miss the profound ambivalence of the film, or its subject, is to admit one’s attention span sits at the Planck scale.) And, there are those who correctly point out the issues which Nolan’s movie omits or gives inadequate attention — in its three hours of content.\nThat-all notwithstanding, I cannot recall a more powerful moment in contemporary cinema than the buildup to the detonation of Trinity. That utter silence — save for the clattering of the 70mm film reel — in which the sold-out audience witnessed physicists’ intellectual fantasy manifest in flames before their eyes, made real in the realm of the material. The universal forces of creation, and structure, and beauty — the spiritual monuments of a young theoretician — being harnessed, in the context of inescapable war, to rend the very fabric of matter asunder, engulfed in a power our Earth had never seen in its four-billion-year existence prior. In that silence, my body could yield only one response:\nI wept.\nWhen I walked out of an IMAX showing at the Metreon downtown — surrounded by jubilant dude-bros torn between fawning at Robert Downey, Jr. and explaining how the movie wasn’t as good as Interstellar — I walked to the curb, a dissociated husk, and collapsed in unmitigated horror.\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna is confronted with the inexorability and numinousness of his role as the carrier of the cosmic force of time, destroyer of the world — perhaps a better translation than “death”, as Oppenheimer famously took from Isherwood’s poetic license in translating from Sanskrit. Every physicist knew what splitting the uranium nucleus meant: “a bomb”. If Oppenheimer had refused to lead the project, a hundred others could have stood in his place — after all, it only took one to fill the post. And if, in the face of changing tides during the war, that leader decided to try and halt the enterprise? “We’ll have him killed,” we hear from Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the personification of the bureaucratic government war machine — not so much a joke as a threat.\nAnd if that leader had succeeded in halting the U.S. development of nuclear arms after the fall of the Nazi regime? What would the world have looked like with the knowledge of fission and fusion devices, leaked by Klaus Fuchs, in the hands of an unopposed Stalin?\nThough Oppenheimer tells us the particularities of this man’s life, the story was not truly about him. He, too, was the vehicle of an inexorable and numinous cosmic force. If the film’s ending is to be believed, then the true blame lies in the tension between two fundamental facets of what it is to be human: on the one hand, our pursuit of structure, meaning, and beauty in the humbling vastness of the cosmos, as the younger Einstein and Oppenheimer sought in uncovering and developing quantum theory, respectively; and, on the other, our taste for wanton destruction in war. The former, in the presence of the latter, has an inevitable — and horrifying — conclusion.\nThe world stands on the precipice. Perhaps the catalyst will be a spark catching the tinderbox in Niger, or Lukashenko making good on his threats to have the now-headless Wagner forces stray from their training of Belarusian troops to march on Warsaw. Perhaps it will be Putin’s bombers making an incursion into UK airspace, or Xi’s carriers venturing into Taiwan’s air defense zone to launch hundreds of simulated direct strikes on the island. But to sit in comfort is now an act of willful ignorance — not realism. World events have slid so far, bit by bit, just at the corner of our vision. My conversations about the news with friends no longer feel like me shouting warnings out into the void; instead, they feel like echoes, reflecting those worries back at me from each pair of eyes. This new feeling frightens me, far more than my own fantasies of destruction ever could.\nI fear that I am not prepared to make the choices that will be demanded of me in the coming years. I have not had to face that impossible decision, of whether to confront an enemy so vast — an enemy with the power to bring about genocide without bound, in the holocaust of the strong force — with a remedy that I know may summon global annihilation. I have not had to face a world where we count the stamps for this month’s eggs. A world where our numbers are seared into our memories. A world in which we struggle for a human right that is different in kind from those we have become accustomed to fighting for: the right for human flesh not to be ripped from bone in the fire of a nuclear sun. A world for which we must serve as caretakers. A world where we must wholly will history away from cataclysm — so that our children may live to carry on our pursuit of justice.\nI learned in the pandemic the incredible measure of our collective resilience. We will adapt; we will, as we always do, use crisis to build something truly new and spectacular. But when I walk across campus to get a coffee or a sandwich — when I see friends gathering for lunch, or for Frisbee on the quad — I can’t help but mourn the loss that I know we will all feel when the world soon falls off that precipice and into darkness.\nThe autumnal equinox approaches, when the lengthening nights accelerate. Though I cling to the hope of the day’s return, I also know that there is a brutal winter ahead. For now, I turn inward — and pray for the strength to make impossible choices. \\(\\,\\blacksquare\\)",

    "text": "In early 2022, after more than a decade trying to find something to ease my mental suffering, I started using the psychedelic medication esketamine under the direction of my doctors. My experiences on this medicine continually challenges my perspective on my own mind and my relationship to the world around me, often in ways that language fails to capture.  \nThinking now about how to focus what I want to write here, I was reminded of one of my earlier ketamine sessions, which struck me with its ineffability:\n\n\nSession 6\n… I decided to use a playlist that was much more energetic for the background to Session 6, which produced wonderful effects. This session again started with vivid closed-eye visualizations, facilitated by a meditative, trance-like state. I tried to intervene actively with my mind in the evolution of these sights much less than I did in Session 5; this time, I was more curious to see what would unfold. At first, my mind gravitated toward the idea of relaxation; “this is like a day at the spa”, I remember thinking to myself, a day to get away from the “work” of previous sessions, a day to relax and unwind with the medicine.\nThat quickly changed. In one scene, I saw from a primordial galaxy a dark-purple grid emerge on a lighter-purple background, and this grid began to warp in different ways—something like a 3D projection of curvature in spacetime. I began to feel myself pulled into the warped sections of the grid—and as I entered, I could physically feel myself, my arms, legs, toes, and fingers, be pulled in different directions.\nMy PhD work is in understanding the interactions between two different types of cells in the brain: on the one hand, neurons, which are more “excitable” cells that will completely flip on for a millisecond or so if one part is given the right input signal by one of their cousins; and on the other, astrocytes, which have much slower (and much less “all-or-nothing”) activations that shape, over seconds to minutes, the ways in which neurons are able to talk to one other. In this moment, I imagined the coupling between these two types of cells, as if it were the pull of gravity, the curvature of spacetime. Though I couldn’t picture it in my sight, I felt for a moment an intrinsic understanding of what it is for two things to be coupled, the “substance” that binds them together. I imagined becoming that substance; I imagined my body becoming the entity that warped purple grid represented. I could feel my limbs subsuming the connection between these two physical bodies.\nAs I delved deeper into space, I emerged in what looked like a microscopy image of cortical brain tissue, with neurons labeled in green and astrocytes labeled in red. As I flew through this 3D picture, I felt a shiver throughout my body; it was as though I could see the whole picture of brain function, as though I had stepped into a wider and more astounding world. In my mind I truly likened this moment to a religious experience. After the visuals subsided, I tried to process the meaning of what I had just experienced for another hour and a half, writing:\n\nI am the tension.\nI am the substance between.\n\nThese words swirled in my head, but seemed almost mystical in quality. The feeling I had wasn’t something that I could formalize or operationalize in the moment. The visions themselves weren’t even particularly novel. But these scenes had a feeling of isness that made them powerful. I didn’t just know the mathematical object representing spacetime curvature; I became it. What it meant, I couldn’t say; but, I knew that it was meaningful.\n\n\nI can’t comprehend the depth of a mind, the immensity of a lifetime of experiences. We look to the unknowable vastness of the cosmos beyond our planet to humble ourselves; and yet, the mundane act of perceiving the taste of my morning cup of coffee seems to rely on an equally mysterious force—the mind, the galaxy within, molded by innumerable moments imperceptibly pulling and pushing every aspect of the world I know in each second.\nThe one tool we have at our disposal to transmit the contents of a mind is the story. Stories are the hereditary material of mental data, the means through which those data — memes, in the original Dawkinsian sense — are replicated and transmitted. Stories are the mirror through which we might see the mind of another, dimly.\nSince that session I have held on to that phrase, the substance between, as a convenient conceptual shortcut to encapsulate my evolving view on stories. In a world made of stories, the energy that serves as the motive force for all things stems from tension—the opposition of many “true” yet nonetheless entirely contradictory stories. This tension is the scaffold that holds up the mental universe. To know one story is not enough to see the world as it is; to understand, we must be able to hold all of those contradictory stories at the same time, and know that what is is greater than these constituent parts. This is the substance between to me: the universe as it is—not the stories, but the tension that holds them together, their intricate relationality.\nIt is common for folks using ketamine to form and repeat these short phrases, capturing some idea they want to hold on to as the drug’s acute effects fade, because it can be almost impossible to commit every indescribable detail of the experience to memory. Like many of my takeaways from my body of work with ketamine, even after months of processing, I struggle to articulate this term’s meaning. But perhaps there is a way to express that meaning through stories, however imperfect each individual projection may be. For now, the substance between is the compass bearing for the world I wish to know. \\(\\,\\triangleright\\)",

People come to bathe in the waters, and time passes. Eons fly by. The buildings change, the people’s clothing changes, the artwork, the scenery.

I arrive at the mountains—no, the cliffs—no, a fortress, a grand fortress in a Chinese architectural style, made of ice and jade, covered in characters embossed in gold. The fortress exudes power and strength. […] \n\n\n\nSession 13, July 2022\nAlmost a year ago, in early January 2022, I checked myself into the hospital down the street from my house because I wanted to kill myself.\nThis wasn’t something new for me — I’ve been in the hospital before for the same reason. And this time wasn’t particularly surprising, either — for months, I had been struggling to keep my head above water. Every few days, triggered by perceived social disappointments or personal failures, I would be sent into an inescapable downward spiral, marching from relentless negative self-talk, to derealization and depersonalization, to repetitive calls for help to friends on every messaging platform available, to thoughts of suicide. I had the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on speed-dial. I had come within an inch of going to the hospital less than a month before.\nMy friends knew there was something wrong with me, but it seemed there was nothing they could do. This was the manifestation of a pattern that had waxed and waned for more than a decade. But this time, the stress of what should have been a wonderful thing — the world reopening from the pandemic — was more than I could handle. Being thrust once again into the social world meant triggers lay around every corner, and as a result, my life had become inescapable suffering.\nIn mid-April, about three months after that hospitalization, I started treatment with a new medicine, esketamine (under the brand name Spravato), which I have been taking now for about nine months. I spent more than a decade in my mental health journey being disappointed by medication after medication, facing horrible side effects with barely any relief. Starting 30 minutes after taking a single dose, esketamine eliminated my symptoms of anxiety and depression, something I had never dreamed possible with the dozens of other medicines I had tried. I went from severely depressed to depression-free in barely the time it takes to drink a cup of coffee. And that alone would have been a miracle for me.\nBut my treatment sessions were far more powerful than that. Esketamine opened up entirely new vistas of mental and spiritual growth. It allowed me to see—to know—who I am as a person, to feel my purpose, to love myself unconditionally. Esketamine broke the shackles that bound me for the entirety of my conscious memory, and allowed me for the first time to live freely and unapologetically as my true self.\nI kept a journal during the first months of my treatment, documenting how I felt before and during each medication session. In this series of posts, I want to explore my experience with this remarkable medicine, and to add my narrative to the dialogue about esketamine and other treatments that alter consciousness. I have found this journey fascinating and humbling—as a patient who has experienced psychic suffering for the better part of my life, as a graduate student studying the mechanisms of brain function, and as a physician-in-training searching for tools to ease the burden of millions of people who have suffered like I have.\n\nMy psychiatric history began before age 12, and over those years I have worn many diagnostic hats. Last January, I wore two specific labels: bipolar disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\n\n\n“Manic depression”, also known as bipolar disorder, drawn by Midjourney\n\n\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have experienced long bouts of depressed mood, lasting from weeks to months. Starting in 2015, I also experienced a couple weeklong bursts of the opposite extreme — incredible euphoria, days without sleep, a feeling that everything was racing and the world was speeding past. The overwhelming default mood, though, was depression: I spent about 8 of the last 10 years depressed, compared with only a couple weeks total in hypomania, the elevated mood state that typifies my kind of bipolar disorder.\n“Depression” is a broad label hiding a multitude of experiences. Sometimes there were years, like my first year of medical school, where I could barely motivate myself to eat because I felt like I didn’t deserve food. Yet I would still somehow manage to put on a smile for friends, show up to class, and accomplish an incredible amount — so much that the vast majority of people around me didn’t know the pain that defined my life as I lived it. In other periods, the sadness became so overwhelming that I lost all ability to cope: feeling as though I had lost all agency, I would run to the bathroom, lock the door, and cry on the floor in the fetal position for hours. My cognition would abandon me, I would feel the ground disappear out from underneath me, and I would be left in an unending fall, an infinite vortex of pain — a knife twisting in my chest that nothing could soothe, that seemed as if it would kill me. I lived out vast swaths of my life—all of high school, most of college, most of medical and graduate school—in states like these.\nThe sadness hurt, but it was not the only component of my mental suffering. My mind had formed in the shadow of years of inescapable trauma, from when I was in kindergarten up through when I was about 15. This was what might be described as “little-t trauma”: not the life-threatening, discrete events that define PTSD, but instead long periods of ongoing pain that created a pervasive sense of being unsafe. My internal model for how the world works —for how interactions with other humans work, for how people view me, for who I am — was created during a time when I was continually hurt by people around me. I hated myself: when mental health providers would ask me my own opinion of myself, I would respond that every other person ever born was truly a human being, but I was not — I was subhuman, not deserving of the same love or happiness as everyone else. I used a medicalized view of my own mental health—of my “illness”—in order to further ingrain this idea:\n\n“Look at these diseases I have that can’t be cured. I am fundamentally broken.”\n\nI would be triggered by stimuli in the environment constantly: it was as if I had no emotional skin, and my raw nerve endings were coming into unprotected contact with the world everywhere I went. Half a second of accidental eye contact with someone on the light rail, the particular way a colleague responded to a greeting, the wrong thing I said to the cashier at the Subway that I knew would make them hate me forever—anything could send me into a spiral, caught in the pain of invasive memories of feelings, people, places from my childhood.\n\n\n\n“Complex PTSD”, drawn by Midjourney\n\n\nThose ever-present moments of being thrust back into my past hurt me, and that constant suffering defined my life. I was so afraid of encountering triggers that I disassembled my notion of self, destroying any hold I had on my personal identity. At every moment, I was whoever I needed to be to avoid the suffering that would come from being triggered. Eventually, I learned to cope as many people who have experienced this kind of trauma do: I learned to retreat from the world. I turned my view of myself as a non-person into my lived reality. When the triggers came, everything around me faded away, until it no longer felt as if what I was experiencing was real. I receded into my own pocket universe, where I didn’t even know that I was the one in the body sitting there, motionless.\nThese automatic strategies—of derealization and depersonalization—did not work in the long run: those initial feelings, almost invariably brought on by something innocuous or even subliminal, would build and build, compounding the suffering until it reached a point where no mechanism at my disposal could contain it. I would send dozens of text messages to my close friends, yelling in agony at them through my phone keyboard. “A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image and affects,” this might be called in the diagnostic manual—especially from the lens of borderline personality disorder, a label given to many people with a history of complex trauma like mine.\nTo me, I was in excruciating pain—pain that I could not bear any more. As I described it to friends many times while I was in these depths, I felt as though I was screaming to everyone that my arm had just been cut off. The responses I got from the people I was closest to — usually silence, sometimes explicit frustration —were completely understandable; but, given that degree of subjective pain, these reactions  only served to reinforce my belief of myself as being subhuman and unworthy of help. This response from my close friends would often hurt far more than the pain I was experiencing from the original trigger itself, reflecting the deep ways in which mental life is affected by the social world that surrounds us.\nEventually, the pain would get so bad that I thought it was going to kill me. These were my darkest lows. When these spirals first happened, I would go on to websites like 7 Cups that let you chat with random strangers, to see if I could find anyone to listen. It never helped: invariably, the person on the other end would get frustrated talking to someone with such immovable beliefs, and they would leave. Each time they left felt like a dagger. After a dozen or so disappointments, I moved on to using the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s online chat or the 988 text line to have someone to talk to. This worked much better than chat sites, but the time limits on each session meant that I couldn’t talk with people—especially not the same person—for as long as I needed to get through the crisis.\nThese spirals have waxed and waned through the years, but over the course of 2021, they escalated to the worst point in my recollection. While the lockdown and the heavily distanced period that followed it had been fairly healthy and productive for me—I was lucky to live with close friends and have very engaging work to fill my days—as the world reopened, I was not prepared for the tidal wave of triggers waiting for me outside the little boxes on Zoom. At first, I would crash every few weeks, triggered by interactions in social get-togethers. Then, I started to have crises every week or so coming from smaller interactions in my day-to-day life. By December, I was having episodes every other day or so, and I stopped being able to even identify what caused them. Each spiral would end with me in bed talking with 988.\nI was desperate and scared. I couldn’t go on living my life the way I was. I knew it. I repeated it out loud: “I can’t go on living like this.” And finally, when my suffering pushed beyond what I knew was the last threshold—when I saw exactly in my mind how I would kill myself—I walked over to the emergency room.\n\nI was referred to esketamine treatment after it was recommended to me by two doctors: my primary outpatient psychiatrist, who I had been seeing for more than three years, and the psychiatrist who worked with me during my rehabilitation after my hospital stay. Right after discharge, I went to an all-day partial hospitalization program, which focused on building skills from the dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) toolkit. The program helped me to build techniques for working with my own mind, and to develop insight for understanding myself. These skills would prove essential for my future work with esketamine. After a few weeks of partial hospitalization, I was referred to a Zoom-based outpatient group therapy program. I didn’t stay there long, though: it was so hard to feel like I was building deepening human connections when I was spending so much time — half a day three days a week — glued to a screen.\nBy this point, a few months had passed since my hospitalization; and, by the time that insurance approvals and scheduling could go through for esketamine treatment, there would be another month delay before I could get into the clinic for my first session. In those weeks—after I left the Zoom group, but before I started esketamine treatment—my mental health took a paradoxical turn: I felt better. Part of it was the change of scenery—after all, my life had revolved around intensive psychiatric care for months, and leaving the group meant I could get back to in person work full-time. Part of it was the real benefit of the DBT skills I had learned, which helped give me the ability to slow down and observe the automatic processes in my mind—although intervening was still hard.\nAltogether, I felt OK, especially relative to my baseline prior to the hospitalization. It wasn’t perfect: I still was haunted by the feeling that everyone around me hated me; I still had nights in bed with the Lifeline Chat on my phone, thinking of suicide. But that little dose of positivity, like the therapy skills I had learned, would be crucial for my future esketamine treatment: I went into my first treatment session with a mindset associating the experience with a positive potential for change.\n\n\nSession 1\nI had no idea what to expect. And, to a degree, I didn’t want to have expectations. All that I had been told about the experience from the esketamine clinic itself was that my appointment would run from 10am to 12:30pm, that I probably wouldn’t want to do any work during the treatment, that I shouldn’t use any alcohol or cannabis during the first few weeks of treatment induction—and, that I should set an intention for my session. My outpatient psychiatrist—who had not delivered esketamine to their own patients—told me to expect that I might feel a little “dissociated”. I couldn’t stop myself from briefly perusing the scientific literature; but, as it seemed that a major goal in ketamine research is to develop a similar compound that acts as an antidepressant but is not otherwise psychoactive, the sense I got was that esketamine for depression might be similar to other antidepressants—just one that, as a controlled substance, has to be delivered under the supervision of a medical provider.\nBut on the off chance that there might be something more to the esketamine experience, I wanted to be prepared. My guiding principle was simple: set and setting, the psychedelic Newton’s law. Setting—the positivity and comfort of the physical and social environment in which the drug session takes place—I figured the clinic would have covered. My focus was on the other half: my mindset, the expectations, thoughts, and feelings that I brought with me, which could profoundly shape the course of my drug experience. I made it my goal to keep my mind focused on the positivity I had been feeling toward this session, right up to the moment I took the medicine.\nI hopped on the light rail train headed downtown about an hour before my appointment — too much time, of course, but I was anxious about being late. On the train ride, I focused myself on picking music that would keep me in a positive place—music that had no negative memories or sadness associated with it. This was quite a task: auditory-tactile synesthesia makes music a powerful force in my life, and since I listen to songs one at a time until I can’t stand them, my “Liked Songs” playlist viscerally evokes the emotional story of my life. But with focused attention I was able to keep the positive vibes flowing. The anthem for my esketamine journeys  became the “Flying Theme” from E.T.—a song that not only captured the energy I wanted for my session, but was also new to me, free from the constraints of memory.

I brushed away intrusive worries; I swept aside momentary queries of what thoughts lay behind other passengers’ gazes. I used every tool at my disposal—including the skills I had learned after my hospitalization—to keep my mind focused on my intention for treatment. I wasn’t scared or overwhelmed, though. I was focused. This mental effort was work toward my well-being. At this point, after so many years of failures or meager successes in my treatment path, I knew that I wanted to change. I felt, more than anything, willingness and openness toward this new step in my journey — factors which would prove to be the key to my experience.\nI climbed the steps of the train station. As I emerged, I was struck by how wrong the weather was for such a hopeful moment in my life: overcast, with immense, ominous clouds rolling by. I laughed a little at this incongruity, and yelled at the clouds in my mind:\n\nThis was the time I needed a sign the most! What are you trying to tell me?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[…] The gates open for me as I flow into the fortress, through the outer chambers, further and further toward the inner sanctum. There are layers and layers of curtains of translucent red, billowing. […] \n\n\n\nSession 13 (continued)\nI got to the clinic well before my treatment time. The folks at the front desk took my temperature as a Covid precaution, and I sat down at a counter to journal. Bits and pieces of my treatment intention had been floating around in my mind in the previous hours and days, but it was here — in a stream of consciousness just a few minutes before my session — where my compass truly crystallized on paper:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last few days I’ve been overwhelmed with feelings that I labeled as anxiety or apprehension, but today, I think the better label would be excitement.\nMy life hasn’t been a train wreck the last month since leaving IOP, and yet I still score as moderate-severe depression on the PHQ-9 and very impaired quality of life on the WHO-5. I know that the reason is simple: the wound remains, festering like an abscess that has been tucked away but is ready to rupture.\nI am scared of people, because I think that they hate me. I construct all sorts of fantasies from this, like “I am less than a person”, but the root is a core belief that every single person around me hates me. I just want you to imagine living inside of that world. Every minute is torture. No place is safe. Only solitude is respite, but the solitude only reminds you of the fact that you are completely and totally alone in the world.\nThis is what I want to change. I want to live in a different world, where I can feel safe. Where I can love. Where I can relax. Where I can let loose my unbridled joy and excitement and awe. \n\n\n\nSession 1 IntentionAs I put the last period on the last sentence, I was called to go one floor down to the portion of the clinic devoted to esketamine treatment.\nThe room was divided into two sections. In the innermost sanctum was a soundproofed office for the induction phase, with a comfy reclining chair for the patient and a small desk for the practitioner. Surrounding this office were six individual “pods”, separated by thick curtains, for patients to relax in after the medicine had started to take effect; each had its own recliner, some plants and art, soft lighting, a bowl of candy, a can of ginger ale, and an expandable barf bag (as nausea can be a side effect of the medication for some people, though I never experienced this reaction).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[…] I arrive at the deepest part of the fortress, a small room with round columns and ceiling beams, painted green and embellished in gold forming the shape of dragons. The dragons have gears and levers on them—the locking mechanism for the secret within—and they begin to turn, wheels within wheels, each finding its proper place one by one. […] \n\n\n\nSession 13 (continued)\nI selected my pod — the biggest one, closest to the front of the room — and sat down in quiet anticipation. A technician took my blood pressure and led me into the inner office, where I was met by my doctor. In that surreal fashion of post-pandemic life, I had never met my doctor in person before this moment. I felt, however, an overwhelming sense of safety: here I was, in this little comfortable nest, with a team there to help guide me through what I was about to experience. My doctor and I talked about how I felt in that moment and my intention for treatment. In a pattern I would repeat in future sessions, in the minutes leading up to when I administered the esketamine, I repeated my intention multiple times, keeping it at the forefront of my mind. Even when the doctor steered the conversation in other directions, I drove it back, holding onto the thought for as long as I could.\nThe doctor showed me an empty demo unit of the esketamine spray, so that I could get used to what it was like to hold it and press down the plunger. They had me blow my nose, so none of the medicine would be lost on the way in. When I was ready, they unboxed my medicine and handed me one spray. I noticed the excitement in my heart: this was the point of no return. I put the spray in my right nostril and plugged my left. I started to sniff in, then pushed the plunger, taking the medicine in strongly and deeply. Again in the left side.\nThe first thing I noticed was the foul, metallic taste in the back of my throat. This, I had been warned, was a common experience with the esketamine — so common, in fact, that it had motivated the candy bowls placed in every pod in the office. I immediately availed myself of a red Jolly Rancher. My doctor and I continued to talk for the next five minutes or so, and I noticed myself becoming much looser and livelier in my speech. My perception was completely intact; yet, somehow, it felt as though words came out of my mouth so easily. I worked hard to keep my intention at the forefront of my thinking and talking, but as the minutes passed, I began to ease into allowing my mind to go in the direction it seemed that it wanted to go. My thoughts controlled my experience; and yet, my thoughts were controlled by my experience. These two forces worked in tension. Above all, I felt completely open—completely willing to have whatever experience I was shown.  My Session 1 playlist\nAfter about five minutes, the doctor handed me the second spray. I had a little more difficulty this time around, but I was able to administer the medicine once again — right nostril, then left. My vision started to change, subtly — the patterns in the carpet, those little bright spots on a field of dark, started to look like fractals, repeating themselves in a surreal way. I didn’t feel like I was able to say any more words to the doctor, so they advised me to put on my headphones and turn on the playlist we had chosen together in preparation for the session—a set of ambient music curated for ketamine-assisted psychotherapy.\nI turned on the music and closed my eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawn by Midjourney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[…] When the wheels on the dragons all align, the lock clicks open and the scene fades away, revealing the treasure inside: the Water Stone, made of lapis lazuli, engraved with living figures. They kiss, they embrace. They love each other. There are more and more of them coming into view—a whole community etched into the beautiful rock, all embracing in a grand circle. The circle grows bigger, and bigger—so big that it is hard to breathe. It feels as though the embrace has taken up the entire room! […] \n\n\n\nSession 13 (continued)\nWithin seconds, the visions came: shapes flowing through my eyesight in shades of cyan and magenta. At first the shapes seemed far away and abstract, as if viewed through a CRT television; but as time passed, the images became more and more clear. I saw whole worlds—whole planets—pass by me. I began to lose touch with my legs, then my arms; I no longer recognized that they were part of my body. Though I never completely lost touch with my existence inside of the clinic room, that idea began to take on a more and more surreal flavor, as I began to be absorbed into these new worlds I was watching in my mind’s eye. I started to get a little scared: I’m having a full-on psychedelic trip, I realized.\nBut I took control over where my thoughts were going, putting my DBT skills into practice. I remembered what I had thought before, sitting in the office with the doctor: I am safe. There are people here who care about me. I was overcome with the feeling that it was ok to experience whatever I was going through right now, in this place. It was ok to be open and receptive to it, to let myself be free. It even started to seem a little entertaining: It must be 2022. My insurance is paying a doctor to watch me trip.\nAs I let go of my resistance, I saw myself moving further and further out: now there were entire solar systems, and then galaxies — a whole universe laid itself out before me. Hours seemed to pass. I felt as though I was one with everything in the entire cosmos — and at the same time, I felt like I was able to look onto the whole universe from outside of it. I felt comfortable in this tension, between connectedness and observation. It was a profound and ineffable experience.\n\n\n\nDrawn by Midjourney\n\n\nI opened my eyes. I noticed my mind become reintegrated with my surroundings, noticed my arms and legs become reattached to my body. I noticed the hard candy still in my mouth, almost unchanged. I asked the doctor how much time had passed.\n“About ten minutes,” they responded.\nTen minutes. To me it had been at least six hours. But it was true: I looked down at Spotify on my phone, and only two songs had passed. The doctor asked me how I felt.\n“I have no words,” I answered. I put the headphones back on and closed my eyes again.\nAlmost immediately, the visions returned, though this time their contents didn’t leave an imprint on my memory. After another ten minutes or so, I came out of my trance and returned to the room again. This time, I was ready to talk to the doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt brought out the joy and wonderment in me, the childlike awe at the universe.\nIT’S THERE!\nIt has always been there inside of me.\nIt’s the part of me that is me. \n\n\n\nSession 1 IntegrationI felt, for the first time in my memory, that I had a sense of my identity, of who I truly was. It didn’t feel as if this identity had been made in the session from whole cloth; rather, it felt that the esketamine had allowed me to find this person, this me, from deep within myself. This new identity was the “childlike” me — the me that was always curious, in wonder, in awe at everything I saw. As I floated through planets and solar systems and galaxies, I felt myself profoundly moved by the depth of the experience, by the immensity of what lay inside my mind. But it was this joyous self that was the real discovery. I felt exuberant, ecstatic, amazed to be flying through this unknown cosmos, discovering. It was fun!\nFor the first time in my recollection I was anchored. Stable. Secure. This was who I was, and who I wanted to be.\nMy doctor was clearly excited to see and hear these results, and they invited me to get up from the chair and dance around a bit in the office. I felt as if I had been bound by ropes and chains and leg irons for so many years — and now, at long last, all of those bindings had been broken, and I was free to be me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[…] As sure as it arrived, the circle of figures in the Water Stone recedes; as it recedes, I arrive beside a canal in Suzhou, the Venice of China. The Water Stone tells me to walk along the canal, and so I walk. But this energy is not enough, and the Stone tells me, Run, run! So I run. I run along the canal.\nAnd the stone says, Jump, jump! And I leap into the air.\nCartwheel! End over end I fly.\nSing! I belt as loudly as I can!\nThe energy is so great that all of the fence posts and bicycles and other assorted things along the path next to the canal dive into the water, forming a great wave that follows me as I go. Two men see the wave, grab boards and jump into the canal, surfing the energy as I cartwheel along.\nThe feeling is that of overflowing vibrancy and life. \n\n\n\nSession 13 (continued)\nAs I sat back down again, I realized that my physical symptoms of anxiety—the tightness throughout my body, the sense of my own heart beating, the intense vigilance toward every detail of my surroundings—had disappeared. I was anxiety-free. “I felt complete peace doing nothing for the first time,” I would write in my journal an hour later. I was, without reservation, entirely content to just be in the moment. It felt as though part of my body had been stuck in the past, reliving my traumas over and over again without the involvement of my mind, and now, for the first time, my body had been reunited with my mind living in this present moment, where the danger was gone, and it was ok to exist as myself.\n\n\n\n“Complete peace”, drawn by Midjourney\n\n\nI leaned back in the chair. In my content and wonder-filled state, I watched as the light from the ominous clouds that passed by outside the office window danced on the ceiling and walls. The beauty and power of it moved me. I thought about how I had decided to close my eyes during the peak, rather than use the eye mask I had been given when I walked in, so just a little bit of light from the outside world could fall on my retinas. I wondered how much of my experience had been caused by those ominous clouds I had jokingly yelled at before. I wondered if I would have had the same visions—the same incredible transformation—if the clouds hadn’t been the exact way they were the moment I had my session. Everything, it seemed, had happened in just the way it had to in order for me to have the experience I was having.\n\nAt this point, about an hour had passed since I first entered the office with my doctor. I felt that my mental state was still somewhat altered, and my extremities still felt a little like Jell-O, but my visual and auditory perception had returned to normal. The doctor walked me back to my pod, and I spent the remaining hour and a half journaling and listening to another playlist of music I had curated before the session.\nThis post-peak period, I came to realize in future sessions, was just as important to my healing as the journey at the peak itself. In this altered state, I had time and space to process what had just been shown to me, to integrate it with my intention for treatment, and to document my experiences so they wouldn’t be lost to memory. This first day, I jotted a quick entry and relaxed to some chamber jazz; but as I looked to the sessions ahead of me, I knew that this was a time that held immense therapeutic potential.\nAn hour and a half, two blood pressure checks, and a small mountain of red and pink Starburst candies later, I had no more lingering effects on my perception, thinking, or movement. I filled out a survey on how dissociated I had felt during the session—“Moderate”, according to the definitions—and walked downstairs to call an Uber. I had to be at work in half an hour for lab meeting. \\(\\,\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\nSince this first experience, I have had over twenty more sessions with esketamine. Some were amusing getaways. Others were profound spiritual journeys.\nIn this series, I will go through my journal to synthesize what I experienced and learned over the course of this life-changing treatment.\nI’ll explore the neurobiology of esketamine in the treatment of depression; the movement to change our understanding of what mental “illness” is and how it comes about; the vast history and base of knowledge in the phenomenology of psychedelic agents; the forgotten psychology of the unconscious mind; the new frontiers of understanding how psychedelics enable mental change; and, how all of this points toward a revolutionary new approach to mental healing—and to fortifying our resilience to prevent suffering from arising in the first place. \\(\\,\\triangleright\\)",

    "text": "I. Astrocytes\nI’m going to talk to you today about astrocytes: Based on notes from presentations at the Fifth International Convention on the Mathematics of Neuroscience and AI and Models of Consciousness 2024.\n(Image.)\nWe don’t tend to talk about astrocytes too much in brain-related spaces—after all, the field is called neuroscience, from which one could infer an implied preference for a particular cell type. However, there are a few things you might be interested to hear about astrocytes.\nFirst: astrocytes make up about a third of the brain, by number of cells. Another third of the cells in the brain are our friends the neurons, and the last third is divided among a diversity of other kinds, like the myelinating oligodendroglia or the wandering debris-eating microglia hailing from our yolk sac. Second: without astrocytes, you die. This an experiment we actually can perform with our present genetic tools, and a number of things go horribly wrong without these cells, problems that are incompatible with life. Finally: we really have no idea what exactly these cells do—at least, not in the same detail, though incomplete, as we know for neurons. Which is a terrifying indictment for a cell type that is nearly equally as abundant in the human brain!\n\nA. Morphology\nThere are a few things we do know, however. Astrocytes have a distinctive morphology, with a small number of larger branches coming off the central cell body—this is how they got their name, “star cells”, from this feature which has been evident since early histological examination of brain tissue in the 19th century from folks like Ramón y Cajal. However, modern advances in microsopy and dye chemistry have enabled us to look closer at astrocytes’ fine architecture. We now know that radiating out finer and finer from these large main branches in each astrocyte are tens of thousands of fine processes, and that these bush-like arborizations from each cell cover distinct, non-overlapping territories, much like a Voronoi tesselation.\n(Image.)\nDistinct from neurons, astrocytes for the most part do not connect with each other using chemical synapses. Instead, they form direct gap-junctional connections with each other, meaning that most astrocytes in the cortex actually have one single, contiguous compartment of cytoplasm. This network1 architecture results in strong shunting of current that makes astrocytes in large part electrically non-excitable. But, the very same organization also means many chemical messages may pass directly between neighboring cells—after all, gap junction proteins like connexin-43 and connexin-30 create literal holes connecting the interiors of astrocytes together! Thought-provokingly, these connections don’t just let anything through: they filter by characteristics such as size and charge, and open and close dynaimcally according to rules we do not fully understand.\n1 Some folks refer to this as the astrocytic syncitium, though this terminology continues to cause some debate among physiologists, for whom this term has a very specific resonance.(Image.)\n\n\nB. Relationships with neurons\nIf you are focusing on how astrocytes might impact the activity of neurons, though, one of the most interesting things we are getting a clearer picture of now is that most chemical synapses in cortex (and many other regions) are tripartite: while classically we envision these connections as principally involving a pre- and post-synaptic neuron:\n(Image.)\nwe now understand that what a good deal of those tens of thousands of processes on each astrocyte reach out toward are synapses, ensheathing them in their end-feet:\n(Image.)\nThis astrocytic third partner in the synapse actively senses many of the canonical signals that neurons do, like neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. In response to these signals, the astrocyte can locally release messengers like ATP or adenosine, which in turn alter the key mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, including the major sources of activity-dependent strengthening (long term potentiation) and weakening (long term depression).2\n2 The evidence for specific molecular pathways of synapse regulation, and even specific mechanisms of astrocytes releasing individual messengers, have been difficult to untangle, and are an ongoing source of debate in the field; a reasonable take, given how biology seems to work, is that the specifics are likely heterogeneous, dynamic, and context-dependent, but the overall portrait of astrocytes impinging on synaptic dynamics through closed-loop feedback of some form is pervasive in the brain.\nVaidyanathan, Trisha V, Max Collard, Sae Yokoyama, Michael E Reitman, and Kira E Poskanzer. 2021. “Cortical Astrocytes Independently Regulate Sleep Depth and Duration via Separate GPCR Pathways.” Elife 10: e63329. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63329.\nOn a coarser level—and perhaps one with greater impact on brain function—astrocytes also have intricate machinery for tweaking the knob on nearby neurons’ excitability. The big levers they use to achieve this are transporters that actively regulate extracellular potassium and glutamate, each of which has its own distinctive way of altering the dynamical regime of exposed neurons. When astrocytes’ intracellular signaling is poked hard enough, these effects are large enough to manifest as gross changes in sleep behavior, and can even selectively change different parameters of sleep, depend on the particular way that astrocytes are messed with (Vaidyanathan et al. 2021).\n\n\nC.

    "text": "The doors open. The sign outside throws itself at me:\nPRESIDIO\nAll at once I’m back in my body, surrounded by music: Ravel’s Boléro. I imagine I must have thought to play it when I was fragmenting. An interesting choice.\nAs the pieces of the world re-join, I walk out onto the platform, and then on toward the North exit. An escalator. Another. Another — a long one, up and out of the station’s massive maw. The day has had a slow and odd enough start that the surroundings force themselves on me, distantly, through the thick bubble of the noise cancellation Inside. The station edifice is a beautiful monument — great shafts of shaped concrete, outstretched into the open grey-blue gradient above, patina’d in the humidity of the nearby sea.\nAs I rise out of it, I pass the statue guarding the austere tube of an entrance: a twenty-foot-wide concrete ellipsoid bearing a clear but intensely abstract resemblance to a bear, resolute. I imagine what it must have been like when this place was first built. Certainly there would have been a Ceremony — there were always Ceremonies. A Mayor, some Councilors. Maybe even a Premier. Dark suits; bright red neckties. A staged photograph with this sculpture, surrounded by the billowing hammer-and-sickle flags of the Republic. Dignitaries. Speeches. The same cool sun, separated only by decades. Lost in its moment.\nThat moment is now interrupted by a gruesome yellow graffito toupée, stenciled atop the artful idol. On the beast’s side, someone has drunkenly carved into the artificial stone:\nFUCK TRUMP\nI look deeper into the surface of the statue, into its blasphemous scars. The dozens of prior attempts. Some have been repaired with greater care, the letters carefully patched so that only a discerning eye could detect the subtle inconsistency in the textured noise. But others — the later ones, I’m sure — are sloppy, splotched over-top without a thought to even matching the color of the solemn rock beneath.\nThe poor creature, I think. It wasn’t its fault.\nI walk out of the station and across the courtyard, toward a thin road that leads into the woods. Far back, before the Revolution, the whole Presidio was a military base, I was told once — though, we never learned much of that history when I was in school. I remember reading the placards when I first moved to the city: the ancient black and white photographs of the squat barracks, neat in a row; their complement, rows of faceless heathens, the American GIs in their funny hats and the infirmary nurses in their pristine white frocks.\nThey are all more than a half-century gone. Here-now stand the stately offices of the Old Regime, painted radiant in this sun, a rare sun. The yellows and blues play in the ether between, a symphony of refraction and shadow dancing on the imposing square. The old Department of Transportation building glows in front of me like a backlit sapphire grasped in a stone talon, its concrete spires gently caressing the thin wisps of cloud.\nThe air is beautiful, ocean and dirt and evergreen. I was lucky to get an office posting here, before the War. On the first go, no less — no need to grease anyone. I was luckier still to keep it after the Reunification. Maybe. Though, perhaps in a different way. Less the luck of the inhumane lotteries, and more the luck of the inhumane allocation of work. What I did, as it happened, was still quite valuable. After the chaos of Privatization, I was in the enviable position of being able to pay the new rent — something I couldn’t say of many of my old office-mates. Even the living ones.\nThe forest road is strange and empty, and I am accompanied only by wind, scent and sound. But the escape is not for long: it is only a couple minutes’ walk to the compound and its telltale sign:\nWeWork Presidio\nThe old State office blocks had such a wonderfully to-the-point name. It feels a bit off-kilter to me now that they’re privately-held. Who exactly is “We”? Why are we Working? Who are we Working for? For so many years, we had been given answers to these questions; and, even though we all knew they were fake, there was something beautiful in the propaganda of it. In the collective knowing, in the ability to dream together. I wonder whose dream it is that I dream now.\nI walk through the manicured courtyard, dominated by a square pool of pure crystalline blue and two pristinely coiffed hedges — one a sphere, the other a pyramid. There are four mid-rise towers, but mine is the tallest and the nicest: Tower D, in the Northeast corner. I walk up the short pedestal of steps it sits on to the first floor lobby: a glass enclosure with vaulted ceilings, entirely open save for the elevator bank at its center. There are two sunken seating areas on either side of the main doors, square pits surrounded by cushions. The upholstery used to be bright red; now, it is navy blue. That had changed quickly, too.\nThe elevators and the flimsy lucite gates protecting them are tucked behind the imposing black figure of the reception desk — its matte laboratory-grade top, its sides of rough slate, straight from the Underworld. The mammoth slab is far too wide for the solitary receptionist sitting behind it. She is hunched over something, scribbling furiously. The clack of my shoes against the polished floor echoes across the cavernous space, and as the sound reaches her, she is awakened from her trance and straightens up at once.\n“Hello, Dr. Halsted.” The recovery is seamless; she is warm, but professional. Her eyes probe me — mechanical and captivating, as though machined by a master watchmaker. She was brought on by the new management a few years ago, a transplant from one of their New York offices. The Old World, with all of its strange codes and hierarchies. She is dressed for her station: black blazer, black turtleneck. Red lipstick. Elegant, but not ostentatious. The thin rims of her glasses are as straight as her bangs.\nA good, class-conscious Capitalist, I think.\nPiercing the void in front of her is a small coloring book, open to a mandala so complex its details escape my myopia. She is meticulous about these things, the coloring pages. Though this one seems particularly outstanding, even from a few paces away.\n“Good morning, Kate.” I walk up to the desk and perch above the book. I lean in, absorbing all of the little spots of color, their immaculate symmetry. “Wow, that’s really something. How long have you been working on it?”\n“Not too long, seems like.” She picks up a blue pencil and sets back to filling in the missing bit of one half-finished space. “But I guess I started when I got in. So it must have been … mmm, two hours, maybe? The time really gets away — not much in and out around Christmas!”\nI run my middle finger lightly over the edge of the circular design. My skin catches a spot at the very frontier, a wreath of fire that the red pencil has been over fiercely, leaving subtle ripples in the paper.\n“It’s beautiful. What does it mean?”\nKate smiles a bit and leans back in her chair, head tilted a few degrees to the right. “What makes you think it means anything?”\n“So it’s meaningless, then?” I look at her and slowly pull back my hand.\n“Well, if you must know,” her eyes glide down toward the figure, “it’s from astrology. I guess I’ve always been a little into the woo-woo stuff.” Her eyes dart back at me. “I’m a Sagittarius. What’s your sign?”\nI feel my left eyebrow raise; I pull it back down as soon as I notice. It’s an odd detail from her. She seems more relaxed than usual.\nIt must be the holiday, I think.\n“I’m not so sure; the horoscopes haven’t been so big here until recently.” This is true; it’s hard to ditch my immediate revulsion to all of Their fake mystical bullshit. Though, our schooling wasn’t so much against spirituality as such; it was against Their spirituality, the symbols and forms used for centuries to coerce and control. Even “Christmas” is still an adjustment; I much pre- ferred the old festivities for the Solstice.\nOf course, our symbols served the same purpose. But knowing this changes the reflex very little.\n“Well, if you look it up, let me know. I’d be curious.” She smiles a little wider, and reaches down below the desk. The left gate opens.\n“Yeah. I’ll do that.” I pause. “Take care.”\nI walk past her and through the transparent portal. I hit the solitary brushed steel nub on the wall, and climb into the second car from the left. I breathe a sigh of relief.\nIt wasn’t the service car that came — good turn.\nI reach out and run my hand along the polished white plastic panels lining the elevator’s interior.\nIt is a painfully slow ride up. I think to myself about how much I hated that interaction. What was I doing, treating this woman like a sexualized child? I used to think about these things more. We all used to think about these things more. Just a few years of being American, and already there are so many of these moments. Moments when I am unrecognizable to myself — moments when I can see the tentacles of Their hatreds metastasizing in my mind.\n“Damn — I’m sorry, Kate,” I whisper to myself.\nI get off on the twelfth floor and bask in its beautiful strips of warm, indirect lights along the ceiling. But then, one cannot avoid the insipid blue carpet. I think indignantly of all of the group psychology that must have gone into the choice of the pattern in the floors from before. The Old Regime was meticulous about that kind of thing. There was probably a whole team at UCLA working on that pattern for years — an entire level of a lab somewhere in Westwood, devoted to psychometric testing of different arrangements and colors, to matching the evoked relational content to the desired particularity of the national esprit de corps. The floor had meaning. This teal monstrosity was clearly put in by the lowest bidder — you can even make out the tears and thready seams from hasty box-cutters along the edges.\nWhat a travesty.\nI get to my office door at the end of the hall. A flimsy Ikea end table holds up an oversized fake plant in front of the floor-to-ceiling window looking out onto the courtyard.\nI’m going to get executed one of these days for criticizing the carpet, I think. I smile; it’s a good thought.\nI open the tall wood door. Noelle is already standing in the front room — mid-pace, rather, beside my coffee table. I look down at my watch; it’s a bit past 9.\nAh, shit. That’s why I came in on Saturday.\n“Maestro!” I smile broadly and bow slightly. “I hope you haven’t been waiting too long.”\n“Oh, Stu. No, not at all. Don’t even think of it.” Noelle is severe. But the two of us have a rapport, and I take her at her word. Her earrings distract me — long, thin cylinders, like gun barrels. Her hands are tucked neatly into baggy, pleated trousers, and her eyes move from me to the window.\nI shoot for friendly with my tone, miss, and land at professional. “Well it’s good to have you around again. How was the show in D.C.?” I move toward the inner office, and gesture with one arm.\nShe leads me in, and sits down on one of the two chairs opposite my desk. She crosses her legs, rubs her forehead with one hand, and sighs.\n“Doesn’t get any easier.”\nI sit down in my cheap little office chair; a small coffee stain on the seat thrusts itself on me. I could afford a better one, but I don’t work sitting that often, so there isn’t much point.\n“Well, we’re all living on borrowed time, I suppose.”\nNoelle looks off at a low bookshelf, half-smiling, intrigued.\n“That’s one way to look at it.” Her neck is craned, and I see on the side the same little black tattoo as the man from the metro earlier. She remote-piloted mechs out of JPL. The Remotes had it harder than the troops on the Front: doing a nine-to-five slaughter from an air-conditioned office, then driving back home to your kids at night. It got worse after Defense realized that adding pain to the percepts increased unit effectiveness.\n“How are the kids?”\n“Lizzie’s been good with the travel. She’s young enough, it’s all just an adventure to her. Roy …” She pauses.\n“He’s older.”\n“The museums were hard. All the flags, and the movies, and the saccharine American grandeur everywhere. The fragility of it. He still sees the Enemy.”\nHe’ll get himself killed over something stupider than carpet, I think.\n“Well, you’ll set him straight.”\nShe chuckles.\nI get serious. “So what brings you in? Do you have another performance coming up?”\n“Yes — we’re doing the Civic Center this evening, as a matter of fact. Prokofiev Five. You’re welcome to come.” She pauses. “You must come, actually; I’ll have them leave a ticket for you at Will Call.” She turns her eyes from perusing the books to me; she seems to have noticed the faux pas. “Sorry it’s on such short notice! You know me.”\n“Prokofiev Five …” I pause for a bit and recall. “Your choice?”\n“My choice, their choice — look, Stu, you don’t want to know the politics of these things, believe me.” Her gesturing is exaggerated for comedy, but she’s clearly sore about it. “The point is, we’ve got a bit of a guest list, and I think it would do well to impress.”\nSuch sibilance in that “impress”; she is trying to make a point.\nMy memory runs thin, and so I send off a quick search and feel the results Inside. It’s a very odd choice indeed — the Moscow premiere with the USSR State Symphony in 1945 was the night the Red Army crossed the Vistula. Prokofiev had to stop for the cannons as he introduced the work. What a resonance.\n“You’re not scheming anything, are you?” I smile out of one corner.\nNoelle throws up her hands. “You caught me. I’m trying to get somebody to endow the contrabassoon chair.” The brazenness of the lie is itself the message. “Do you have something for me or what?”\nI look straight at her, feigning insult. “Well, of course. I could give you a——”\n“Ah ah ah — we’ve talked about this.”\n“… Right.”\nBut it’s not right, ’Elle; it’s wrong. Even my internal monologue is exasperated. One of these times, I’m going to put you in a mental hospital with your “surprises”, and Ancestors know what details they can pull out of the Neuralink. It’s a crapshoot every time.\nI worry about me. I worry about her. I worry about the kids.\nI walk over to a taller bookcase behind my desk, and open a Cuban cigar box sitting on the second-highest shelf. I pull up the false bottom, and grasp a plain green card between my fingers — one of two parts of an encryption key for my collection. The other is on the storage for my implant, tucked into my clavicle and locked with my semantic footprint. I tap the card with my phone.\nInside, I feel the database index as it unlocks. I walk around through it, listening to the music, touching the metadata of the Dreams. It takes about five minutes wall time to get through the whole piece, with the dilation. The first, second, and fourth movements come to mind quickly. But the third — the third is the most important one, and there’s two choices in my index that roughly fit the timing, knowing how fast her mind runs. At least, I think so.\nMother — I hope she doesn’t do something stupid like pop some Z right before she goes on. That would kill the arc.\n“How far do you want to go with this, ’Elle?”\n“Give me your worst.”\nWell, that settles it then. I reach into my bag and pull out the stims. I walk around behind where she’s seated, and gently place my hands behind her ears.\n“Now of course, I could give them to you raw, and you could feel it well enough. But I assume——”\n“Mais non — I want it as real as it gets.” She makes an exuberant flourish with her right hand. “Lift the veil, Comrade Isis!”\nYes, ma’am.\nAs the stims tickle her, the storm of fibers within her cranium comes into sharp relief. I feel around for a second — professional courtesy. And there’s no denying it. Her psychosis is getting worse. Her dependence is getting worse. It’s all bad — this shit is killing her.\n“’Elle——”\n“Zip! I know where your head’s at, and we’re just going to nip that one right in the bud.”\nI pull back my hands, and send the axon cloud over to the cluster for the Dream tuning. There’s no sense putting up a fuss — I’m just the middleman. \\(\\,\\triangleright\\)\n\nContinued.",
